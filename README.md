Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively.

## What is Dynamic Programming?

_Dynamic Programming_** (DP) is a programming paradigm that can systematically and efficiently explore all possible solutions to a problem. As such, it is capable of solving a wide variety of problems that often have the following characteristics:
+ The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems" - smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times.
+ The problem has an "optimal substructure" - an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems of the original problem.
